* ob-restclient.el
[[https://melpa.org/#/ob-restclient][file:https://melpa.org/packages/ob-restclient-badge.svg]]

  An extension to restclient.el for emacs that provides org-babel
  support.

  To get started, install =ob-restclient.el= and add =(restclient . t)= to
  =org-babel-load-languages=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((restclient . t)))
  #+END_SRC

  You can then execute the query by pressing =C-c C-c= on the
  source-block header.

  header arguments for =:results raw|value|pure|table= will make a clean
  result containing solely the response, and =:jq PATTERN= will
  post-process the response by passing the value to =jq=, provided the binary
  exists at a location specified by =org-babel-restclient--jq-path=

    #+BEGIN_SRC org
      ,#+BEGIN_SRC restclient
        GET http://example.com
      ,#+END_SRC

      ,#+RESULTS:
      ,#+BEGIN_SRC html
      <!doctype html>
      <html>
      <head>
        ...
      </head>
      </html>
      ,#+END_SRC
    #+END_SRC
